# Fixed Point Numbers

![Github Actions](https://github.com/AbitTheGray/FixedPointNumbers/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)

Library to allow working with fixed-point numbers.

64-bit computer recommended as this library expects `std::size_t` to be equivalent to `uint64_t`.
Other (smaller) variants (=32-bit computers) are not fully supported and therefore may not work (correctly).
